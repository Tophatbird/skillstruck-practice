string1 = "you can have multiple numbers like {} and {}"
value1 = 1
value2 = 3
print(string1.format(value1, value2))
#this is just the last lessons note btw


#something new is that if you put numbers in the curly brackets (starting from 0) you can choose what goes where
#string1 = "you can have multiple numbers {0} , {3} , {2} , {1} and {4}
#value1 = 1
#value2 = 2
#value3 = 3
#value4 = 4
#value5 = 5

#print(string1.format(value1, value2, value3, value4, value5))
#this will go in order of 0-4 but the print will put the numbers in the order you listed
